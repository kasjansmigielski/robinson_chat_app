### The goal of the project was to implement RAG technology on a selected text.

For this purpose, the text of Robinson Crusoe was used, and all implementations
were developed in the form of an application resembling a chatbot that answers
questions related to the book. 
The Streamlit library was used - for creating simple applications, enabling intuitive use of available functionalities even for non-technical users. The
Robinson Chatbot application is designed to enable asking questions related to
reading and generating answers through LLM models - based on the provided
extended context.
### Main functionalities of the application
The application enables several basic functionalities:
1. Asking questions in chat - the user can ask a question related to the
content of the reading used.
2. Using ready-made sample prompts - the user selects options from a
list of specially prepared prompts.
3. Generating responses by chatbot - based on the extended context of
the question - the AI model generates an answer related to the content of
the reading.
4. Ability to select an AI model - the user selects the model from the
drop-down list that will be responsible for generating the response.
5. Tracking the costs of using AI models - the user can check how much
individual queries and answers generated by AI cost.
6. Conversation editability - the user has the ability to create new conversations, switch between them and change their names.
7. Giving awareness to the chatbot - the user can experiment and change
the chatbotâ€™s personality and observe the impact of individual settings on
the generated responses.
All these functionalities are combined into one interactive application that anyone can use - without the need for specialist knowledge.
